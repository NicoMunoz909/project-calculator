Simple calculator made with JS, HTML & CSS.
It has keyboard support as well.
Have yet to handle all error cases such as entering multiples operators in a row, but it works fine as long as you enter input as expected (number, operator, number, operator...).
Will update and handle all error cases in the next few days, I fell it was in a good working state already and wanted to move on with the curriculum.
